## About
Hi, I am CJ from Linux-Gamer. This site is a brief incite into how the channels
are run and how I work. The main few things to know is that I mainly use an
Asus Vivobook X705 running Windows 11; however for doing certain things, I use an Asus X553MA running Kubuntu 22.04. The computer that I originally started the channels on was a Lenovo Ideapad 110 running Windows 10. Other things to note are that I am a “talented” artist and am quite knowledgeable with technology.

## Where I Started:
I started as a content creator back in December 2020 because I wanted to provide entertainment to people during the COVID pandemic. Since then, I have grown to like being a content creator and with 60 followers on Twitch and (on the old YouTube channel) having 33 subscribers, I have decided to continue making content for the entertainment of others. Even from a young age I enjoyed helping others and this is doing that but in a very different way. If you haven’t already go check out the channels (links are in the bar at the top).
